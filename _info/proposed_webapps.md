# Proposed Webapps for F18

* Add all ingredients found in my kitchen into webapp. The app scrapes recipes found online that I have ingredients to make.
* QA App: An app where you can type any question in your head, and it will notify any user in an acceptable radius (geographically). Those people have the option to respond or ignore. Points awarded if answer given.
* All public events hosted at UCSB organized in an easy to view format.
* An app where you input class schedule or Google Calendar, and it will provide an alarm schedule for week that gives you best and most consistent sleep schedule.
* A webapp where students can sell/give away textbooks, iclickers, notes, etc.
