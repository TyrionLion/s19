  <i> "Hello I am Alex Ermakov. I have completed my undergrad here at UCSB and now I am in the first year of my Master’s. Some of my hobbies include video games, sports and just making stuff. My current area of research is natural language processing relating to first response to a natural disaster and discovery of communication infrastructure damage.I am really excited to get everyone started with learning Java, program design and the foundations of software engineering. If anyone need help or advice with either debugging or summer internships I have some useful tips from my experiences." </i>

  <b> Xiyou Zhou (TA) </b>
  <i> "Hi, I’m Xiyou Zhou, a 2nd year PhD student in Computer Science Department. It’s been exciting working with you as a TA for CS 56. This course, we aim to help you learn basic programming skills in java and be prepared for later study, research and your future career. For most of you starting as a beginner, it’s hard to understand concepts and debug programs. Don’t worry, feel free to contact us, we are here to help. You can find me either on piazza or by email: xiyou@cs.ucsb.edu. La Java, C'est la vie." </i>

    <b>Max Kiss (Tutor)</b>
    <i> "Hi everyone! My name is Max Kiss. I am currently in my 3rd year as a Computer Science major. In my free time I enjoy playing games, surfing, and hiking. I have experience making games in Unity and experience with a few different databases and platforms. While I usually work in C++, I have recently created web apps in Java and Python Flask. I also created a Discord bot using Python. I currently help work on the campus app GoGaucho, and this summer I will be working on software relating to rocket launches. Feel free to ask me about anything. I look forward to helping you throughout the quarter!" </i>

    <b>Ekta Shahani (Tutor) </b>
    <i> "Hi everyone! My name is Ekta (she/her/hers) and I'm a third year Computer Science major. I'm excited to tutor for CS 56 this quarter and help you grasp new and exciting material in a way that matches your learning style. I believe everyone learns in different ways and look forward to working with you one-on-one to make this class a valuable experience for you. I've used Java for personal projects and during internships (feel free to ask me more if you're interested). I'm also Co-President of Coders SB and Industry Chair of Engineering Student Council. If you need any tips or want to talk more about CS at UCSB, student orgs, or my experiences, please reach out during open lab hours or via Piazza! Outside of school, I love playing guitar, reading, cooking, watching Netflix, and hanging out with friends. Looking forward to a great quarter!" </i>
