Coming soon

<hr>

Previously, in {{page.prev_num}}, you worked with a small Hello, World app based on a web technology known as SparkJava.

We learned a few concepts there, such as:
* Working with Maven
* Getting a simple Java web app up and running on localhost and checking that it is up and running
* Getting that webapp up and running on Heroku

We are now going to turn to a different Java web framework, one called Spring Boot.

Spring Boot is:
* A bit more challenging to work with that SparkJava, but
* More widely supported, documented
* An entry way to learning about a technology called Spring, which is widely adopted and used in practice in "real world" Java web app development.

We'll start by putting up a simple Hello World app, and then a little at a time, we'll add some features to that app, documenting as we go.
