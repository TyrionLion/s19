# Step 1: Hold an Agile Standup Meeting (Scrum)

 
As part of your standup, each team member should update the team with:
* What they've done since last standup
* What they are committing to work on between now and next standup
* Any roadblocks or barriers to progress 

ALSO: the entire team should review the Kanban Board (linked to from the Kanban Board 
column of the [Teams Spreadsheet](https://ucsb-cs56-f18.github.io/info/teams/]):

* Update the team on what is waiting for QA, Graded or Done
* Update the team on what is in-progress
* Check to see how many more points may need to be dragged into "In Progress" for 
   the team to meet the 1000 or 1100 point goal.

<div class="mentor" markdown="1">

* Mentor: Record attendance for the standup 
   * Record it in the PRIVATE team feedback repo 
      (linked to from <https://ucsb-cs56-f18.github.io/info/teams/>)
   * If any team members are present at lab, but arrive late for standup, note that as well.
  
</div>

# Step 2: Make a plan

After the standup, but as a team, discuss when/where you will meet up again next between now and the 
deadline for completing your issues, which is midnight Tuesday.

Review your "minimum viable product" and issues, and if needed simplify, and/or add new issues 
(or skunkworks projects), that your mentor approves, that will get you to the goal and are feasible
in the timeframe left.

Discuss with your mentor the timeline for getting issues QA'd and graded Wednesday and Thursday.

# Step 3: Ask for help with roadblocks

If you have any remaining technical roadblocks:
* post them first on your teams internal communication channel
* then, post on Piazza

Offer help to others too, that may be stuck.

# Step 4: Work on your issues

Get 'em done!
