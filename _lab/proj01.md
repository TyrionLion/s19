# Creating Your Story Map

1.  Gather in your team; see the new seating chart here: 

* <https://ucsb-cs56-f18.github.io/info/lab_seating_chart_5pm/>
* <https://ucsb-cs56-f18.github.io/info/lab_seating_chart_6pm/>
* <https://ucsb-cs56-f18.github.io/info/lab_seating_chart_7pm/>

2. Think about the "user journey", that is, all of the events that lead someone  to turn to your webapp and have an interaction with it, or perhaps a series of interactions. There should be a beginning, a middle and an end, where value is exchanged: the user came with a goal, need, or desire, and that goal was met, that need was satisfied, or that desire was fulfilled. 

* What is that goal, need or desire?
* What is the series of events, in chronological order?

Discuss this with your group, and on your paper, write down whatever comes to mind.  

At this stage, there is not "right or wrong" way to get your ideas down on the paper.  Just write something
that captures the group consensus, or the candidate proposals, for the "user journey".

It can be a list, or pictures, or separate <tt>As a __ I can __ so that __ </tt> type stories, but don't get bogged down
on what form it takes.  Just get something down.

NOTE: Try to keep your description VERY HIGH LEVEL, avoiding specific implementation details.

* Good:  User selects a beverage from among several choices
* Too much detail: User clicks on a drop down menu; each beverage has an image which  flashes with an animation as you hover over it, etc. etc. 

You don't have to do this "perfectly" the first time.  You may need to first get it all out as "brain dump" that contains too much detail, and then move to a higher level.  But get to the higher level as soon as you can.

Don't move on to the next step until you have the "spine" of your customer journey captured in some fashion.

You'll know you have it, and you are ready for this step when:

* It tells a coherent story.  You can describe this to any reasonable person 
   (e.g. a UCSB student that isn't in this class, particularly one that might be a target user) 
   and they will be able to follow what you are saying.
* None of your "spine" should be "implementation" focused.    It shouldn't depend, for example, even on whether
  it happens to be a webapp, or a mobile app, or even an app at all.    It shoudn't depend on technology specifics.

* The <b>value exchange</b> part is clearly identified: the goal/need/desire of the user, and how that gets acheived/met/fulfilled

3.  Now you have an outline, in some form (whatever form seemed reasonable to you)

At this stage, the story you have might have gone in one of two directions:

* **Grand Vision** (GV): You might have a story that really is very much your "ideal dream state" of the application when fully built out.   Keep in    mind that this may be far more than you can reasonably accomplish in the next 4 weeks.
* **Minimum Viable Product** (MVP) You might have already been thinking in terms of "minimal viable product", and you might have a really nice thin slice of value for your end user, something you might *actually* be able to deliver in  4 weeks (or 1 week, or even 1 day.)
   
It's likely that each of our teams will be somewhere on the spectrum between these two extremes.  Discuss where you think
your team is on that spectrum.
   
Assuming that your team is somewhere closer to GV than to MVP, you'll now want to set aside the description of your
GV for the moment.  Use it as a reference to inform your efforts to redo the exercise, but focusing on an MVP.

Maybe you can draw on top of your GV description, and circle the parts (in a different color) that you think might
be part of your MVP.

The big question to keep in mind is:

> How can we make "this" possible for the user with less complexity, less code, less time

Here "this" is the goal/need/desire.
