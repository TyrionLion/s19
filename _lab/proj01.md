# Creating Your Story Map

1.  Gather in your team; see the new seating chart here: 

* <https://ucsb-cs56-f18.github.io/info/lab_seating_chart_5pm/>
* <https://ucsb-cs56-f18.github.io/info/lab_seating_chart_6pm/>

2. Think about the "user journey", that is, all of the events that lead someone  to turn to your webapp and have an interaction with it, or perhaps a series of interactions. There should be a beginning, a middle and an end, where value is exchanged: the user came with a goal, need, or desire, and that goal was met, that need was satisfied, or that desire was fulfilled. 

* What is that goal, need or desire?
* What is the series of events, in chronological order?

Discuss this with your group, and on your paper, write down whatever comes to mind.  

NOTE: Try to keep your description VERY HIGH LEVEL, avoiding specific implementation details.

* Good:  User selects a beverage from among several choices
* Too much detail: User clicks on a drop down menu; each beverage has an image which  flashes with an animation as you hover over it, etc. etc. 

You don't have to do this "perfectly" the first time.  You may need to first get it all out as "brain dump" that contains too much detail, and then move to a higher level.  But get to the higher level as soon as you can.
