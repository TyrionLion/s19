# Creating Your Story Map

1.  Gather in your team; see the new seating chart here: 

* <https://ucsb-cs56-f18.github.io/info/lab_seating_chart_5pm/>
* <https://ucsb-cs56-f18.github.io/info/lab_seating_chart_6pm/>
* <https://ucsb-cs56-f18.github.io/info/lab_seating_chart_7pm/>

2. Think about the "user journey", that is, all of the events that lead someone  to turn to your webapp and have an interaction with it, or perhaps a series of interactions. There should be a beginning, a middle and an end, where value is exchanged: the user came with a goal, need, or desire, and that goal was met, that need was satisfied, or that desire was fulfilled. 

* What is that goal, need or desire?
* What is the series of events, in chronological order?

Discuss this with your group, and on your paper, write down whatever
