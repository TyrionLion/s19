This page describe what mentors need to do to support their teams to work on proj01.

# Step 1: Make sure you have the access you need

You will need:

* To have edit access in the following Google Drive folder 
   * [{{google_drive_folder_name}}({{google_drive_folder_url}}).  
   * This folder should be accessible only to Instructors, TAs, and tutors/mentors for {{site.course}}, {{site.qxx}}
* To be an owner in the following github organizations: 
   * [ucsb-cs56-f18](https://github.org/ucsb-cs56-f18)
   * [ucsb-cs56-webapps](https://github.org/ucsb-cs56-webapps)
   
# Step 2: Choose which team you will mentor

Consult the lab seating chart pages for your lab section:

* https://ucsb-cs56-f18.github.io/info/lab_seating_chart_5pm/
* https://ucsb-cs56-f18.github.io/info/lab_seating_chart_6pm/
* https://ucsb-cs56-f18.github.io/info/lab_seating_chart_7pm/

Let one of the TAs or instructors know which team you want to mentor, and have them add your name to the chart.

Or better yet, access the editable version in the Google Drive folder [{{google_drive_folder_name}}({{google_drive_folder_url}}), and add your name directly to the team of your choice.

# Step 3: Locate the corner of the room where that team is meeting

There should be a flip chart there for them to work from, along with flip chart markers.

If it is available, we might also use Phelps 3526 for one or more of the teams.

# Step 4: Create a repo under [ucsb-cs56-webapps](https://github.com/ucsb-cs56-webapps) for your team

Create a repo called `ucsb-cs56-project-name` where `project-name` is the name your team chooses for its project.
