The instructions for this lab are fairly self explanatory.  

The main goal is that by the end of each 50 minute lab period:
* ALL QA and grading is done, absolutely finished, 
* The students know where they stand vis-a-vis their final 1000 or 1100 points.
* The repo is ready for the next time that CS56 is offered
   * Pull requests have been accepted or not
   * The code in the ucsb-cs56-webapps repo on the master branch is the students final, final work, including their
      "note to the next generation".
 
If all goes well, there should be NO OUTSTANDING left over work at the end of the 50 minutes this evening.
