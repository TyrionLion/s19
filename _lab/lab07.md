</li>

<li markdown="1"> (10 pts) Locate your feedback repo by visiting http://github.org/ucsb-cs56-f18 and searching for FEEDBACK.
  If you don't have access to it, ask your mentor for help.
  
* Read through it.  
* You should see  feedback from your mentor, detailing the pull requests and issues for which your team is supposed to get credit.
* Make sure you understand everything that is there, and that the list is a COMPLETE list of everything for which you are expecting to get credit.  
* Make sure the final understanding is RECORDED IN THE FEEDBACK REPO, not just a verbal agreement.
* When you've done that, get your mentor to initial here: <code>____</code> and you initial here: <code>____</code>  and record the date/time here: <code>____</code>  to indicate that the feedback repo, at that time, is complete and that you accept what is there.
* If there is any dispute about that, bring it to the instructor's attention NOW before this lab is done.
  </li> 
  
  <li markdown="1"> (10 pts) Now look in the repo and see if your TA (Jinjin or Santha)  
  * assigned the final points (i.e. grade our of /1000 plus extra credit out of /100) for your team based on the issues you completed, and the feedback from your mentor, and
  * has recording that feedback IN THE FEEDBACK REPO (not just told you).
  * When that's done, you initial <code>____</code>  and your TA initials here:<code>____</code> and record date/time <code>____</code>.
  * If you presented in lecture, make sure that 50 pts is recorded by Prof. Conrad near the bottom of the repo.
  * If there is any dispute about that, bring it to the instructor's attention NOW before this lab is done.

THEN TURN OVER THE PAGE FOR THE REST OF THE 100 points for this lab.

<div class="pagebreak"></div>

</li>
 

<li markdown="1"> (20 pts) Now, return to your team, and meet with your mentor.  Go through the list of issues for team, one at a time, and have your mentor:
* CLOSE any issues that are actually fully resolved. 
* If the issue is partially resolved, enter a NEW issue for the unresolved part (that the {{page.next_class_qtr}} team will work on), and get the mentor to estimate it.
* Then, work with the mentor to put in at least 500 points worth of new issues for the {{page.next_class_qtr}} team to work on. (If you already have 500 point worth of issues, estimated and ready to go for {{page.next_class_qtr}}, you are done. Otherwise, work together with your mentor on this until it is finished.

MENTORS: Add a tag for <tt>{{page.next_class_qtr}}</tt> and, if you don't already have one, a tag for  <tt>mentor approved</tt>.   Use the point value tags, and try to stay with values of <tt>100</tt>, <tt>200</tt> and <tt>400</tt> only.


When this is done, you initial <code>____</code>  and your TA initials here:<code>____</code> and record date/time <code>____</code>.
</li>

<li markdown="1" style="clear:both;"> (50 pts) YOUR LAST RESPONSIBLITY IN THIS COURSE: Make a branch in the <tt>ucsb-cs56-{{site.qxx | downcase}}</tt> version of your repo.   Do some final edits in the README.md file of the cs56/{{site.qxx | downcase}} directory in your repo.  Put in a section called “{{site.qxx}} final remarks” and in it, write a short “note” to the next set of students that will work on this legacy code project.

Tell them exactly what you think would be helpful for them to know as they start the project: what the code does, what features could be added, what bugs exist, what opportunities for refactoring you see. Also add any advice you have on working with the code you have left them, for with legacy code in general.

Do a pull request with that, and get the mentor to look at it, and approve that you did it: ______

And you are done!
